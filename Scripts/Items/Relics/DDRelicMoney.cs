// This file has been refactored for better maintainability.
// The original classes have been moved to separate files:
// - DDCurrencyConstants.cs - All constants
// - DDCurrencyStringConstants.cs - Localized strings
// - DDCurrencyItem.cs - Abstract base class
// - DDCopper.cs, DDSilver.cs, DDJewels.cs, DDXormite.cs, DDGemstones.cs, DDGoldNuggets.cs - Individual implementations
//
// The original implementations are now split across multiple files for better organization.
// This file can be safely removed after confirming all references work with the new structure.
